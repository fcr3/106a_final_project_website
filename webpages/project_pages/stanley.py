	For each controller functions were written to take inputs and process needed

	to call the Stanley Controller instead of the already existing PID controller,

	(no vehicles finished the off road course in the first year). It has been
	adapted and tested in other situations and is a well known alternative to
	controllers such as standard PID and Pure Pursuit controllers. We stuck
	with the specifications that were described in the Stanley controller paper.

	The Stanley lateral controller takes as inputs the position and pose of the

	function into the vehicle reference frame, which is used to further process
	the data. The data is processed to determine the distance the vehicle is
	away from the desired path as well as the difference in heading of the
	desired path trajectory and the vehicle. This information is returned to
	where controller parent as cross track error and heading error, where it is
	fed into the following formula to determine the steering information sent to
	the vehicle actuator:

	From our observations, $k=1.8$ worked the best.

	While the Stanley controller works most of the time, it does not work very
	well, in that it has uncovered a situation where the next waypoint provided
	by the system does not always update.  We plan to alleviate this problem by
	modifying the code to cycle through the way point queue to the next available
	whenever it is calculated the waypoint is behind the vehicle.  The controller
	seems to work fine other than this glitch.
