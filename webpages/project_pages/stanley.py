	From our observations, $k=1.8$ worked the best.

	While the Stanley controller works most of the time, it does not work reliably,
	in that it has uncovered a situation where the next waypoint provided by the
	system does not always update. Because the Stanley controller uses both heading
	and crosstrack error as inputs to the steering command, the misinformation
	provided by the expired waypoint sometimes causes the heading error to cancel
	the crosstrack error, resulting in a near zero steering command in a turn.
	This causes the vehicle to proceed straight to the outside edge of the curve.
	We plan to alleviate this problem by modifying the code to cycle through the
	way point queue to the next available whenever it is calculated the waypoint
	is behind the vehicle.  The controller seems to work fine other than this
	glitch.
