	basketball, practices his dancing to be a Jabbawockee, and sleeps.

	Christian worked on the ground plane detection applications within ROAR,
	including the flood fill algorithm and the sparse sampling + KNN algorithm
	for roll calculation. He also helped Michael with the gym-tuned PID controller
	and helped implement the roll controller. His contributions to the gym-tuned
	PID controller include deciding the learning algorithm and conceptualizing the
	reward/penalty system. Michael and Christian consulted Professor Allen Yang,
	Professor Sastry, Michael Estrada, and Tyler Westenbroek for RL best practices
	and how to best create our learning environment. He also helped design the project
